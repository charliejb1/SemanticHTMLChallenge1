Description:
Horiseon's digital marketing website needed updates for both html and css elemnts for better user accessibility. 
Semantic HTML elements,logical structuring and descriptive alt texts all enhance the accessibility of their website.


Changes made:

Semantic Elements and Logical Structuring-

Html previously used "div" in numerous areas to divide certain sections of the page. These were all replaced with semantic html elements such as: header, nav, main, section and aside.
In order to maintain a logical structure within html, the new semantic elements matched how sections of the website are currently divided.
The header of the page is now labeled as "header" with "nav" being a child element of it (nav contains the unordered list of the three navigation tabs)
The hero image of the page is now contained within "figuure" in html.
The main content below the hero image, contining 3 sections, is now labeled as "main". Within "main" are 3 sections containing content for: SEO, Online Reputation Manegement, and Social Media-Marketing.
These are now labled as "sections" in html. 
The side section containing information about lead generation, brand awareness, and cost management is now labeled as "aside" within html.
The child elements within the aside are now labeled as "figures" they are the images pertaining to the 3 topics within the aside.                              
The footer of the page is now labeled as "footer" within html and the h2 heading within it has now been updated to h4 to folow logical structure. 
The h2 within CSS for this footer was also updated to h4 to match the html for selection. 
within CSS, ".header div", ". header div ul", and "header div ul li" had the "div" replaced with "nav" to match the html for selection

Alt Text-

The 3 images in the main sections of the content were updated to have descriptive alt text.
The 3 icons within the aside were updated to have descriptive alt text.
The hero image was updated with alt text as well.
